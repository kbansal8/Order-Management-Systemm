# Order Management System
 I have created an order managament system in Java, and have used a JDBC to link it to my SQL database. I have ,thus, imported value from SQL table that I created and have created a system to manage long queues in restaurants. All restauarants pretty much work on FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS, but for people who just buy a wate rbottle or something readily available, their order should be prioritised first.(For eg: The restaurants will give a water bottle to a customer further down the line as compared to someone who was first, but ordered 7 burgers).
